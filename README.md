# MIT6.006
Introduction to Algorithms

The second MIT-Opencourseware course I have completed.
With each new algorithm I implemented my own version after hearing the lecture and before studying the pseudocode in order to gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm.

This course touched on a wide variety of algorithms including trees, graphs, numerics, dynamic programming, and search methods.

I refer to things I have learned in this course regularly, and highly recommend it to anyone wishing to expand their algorithmic knowledge.
